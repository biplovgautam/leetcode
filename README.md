# 30 Days LeetCode Challenge

## Journey Overview
This repository documents my 30-day journey through LeetCode problems. I focused primarily on easy to medium difficulty questions to build a solid foundation in algorithm and data structure concepts.

## What I Learned

### Week 1: Basics and Arrays
- Array manipulation techniques and optimizations
- Two-pointer approaches for problems like Valid Palindrome and Two Sum
- Bit manipulation fundamentals (Counting Bits, Reverse Bits)
- How to identify and implement efficient solutions for common array problems

### Week 2: Strings and Binary Search
- String processing and manipulation
- Binary search implementation and applications
- Efficient linked list operations
- In-place array modifications

### Week 3: Trees and Recursion
- Binary tree traversal techniques
- Recursive approaches to tree problems
- Understanding balanced trees
- Depth-first vs breadth-first approaches

### Week 4: Advanced Problems
- Handling integer conversions and edge cases
- Palindrome variations and efficient checking methods
- Two-pointer techniques for more complex problems
- Working with numerical constraints and optimizations

## Key Takeaways
1. **Pattern Recognition**: I've started to identify common patterns across different problems
2. **Multiple Approaches**: Learning to evaluate different solutions based on time and space complexity
3. **Edge Cases**: Became better at identifying and handling edge cases
4. **Code Efficiency**: Improved writing clean, efficient solutions

## Moving Forward
